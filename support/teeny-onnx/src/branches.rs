//! Resolving `If` nodes whose condition is known at compile time.
//!
//! An exported model is full of branches the author never wrote. Tracing a
//! `x.squeeze(1)` emits `if x.shape[1] == 1 { squeeze(x, 1) } else { x }`, because the
//! trace cannot know the extent. In a static export that extent *is* known, so the
//! branch is decidable and only one side of it is real code.
//!
//! Resolving it has to happen in three stages, and the order is forced:
//!
//! 1. the import keeps both branch bodies without importing either
//!    ([`crate::onnx::IfBranches`]),
//! 2. [`crate::materialize`] folds the condition to a constant,
//! 3. this pass imports the taken body and makes the `If` a pass-through of its result.
//!
//! The reason the bodies cannot both be imported at step 1, with a select afterwards,
//! is that a guarded branch is usually only *valid* under its guard: the squeeze above
//! is an error whenever the condition is false. Importing both would put an operation
//! in the graph that cannot run, and lowering has no way to know it must not.
//!
//! The reason the decision cannot be made at step 1 either is that the condition is
//! computed, not stored. It is `Equal(Gather(Shape(x), 1), 1)` and so on: a constant
//! only in the sense that folding can reach it.
//!
//! A branch body may itself contain an `If`, whose own condition only becomes constant
//! once the body is in the graph and folded. This pass therefore does one round and
//! reports what it did; a caller with nested branches alternates it with
//! [`crate::materialize::materialize_constants`] until it reports no progress. See
//! [`resolve_if_branches`].
